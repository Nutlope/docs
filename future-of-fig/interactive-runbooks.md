# Interactive Runbooks

>ðŸš¨ This is currently unsupported, but is in Fig's product roadmap. We built an early prototype of it and plan to add full support in the future.

Interactive Runbooks make static documents interactive. They live right next to your terminal and are easy to create and share. 

Runbooks are written in Rundown. Rundown is based on [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) but also lets you add form elements, run code blocks, and even run shell commands. Interactive Runbooks use the `.run` file extension.

<!-- ## Get Started

We recommend using examples to get started.

- Download [full runbooks]()
- View examples for each of the [form elements]()
- Learn how to [run runbooks]() -->
