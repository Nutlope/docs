# Getting Started

Welcome to the Fig documentation!

[Fig](https://withfig.com?ref=github_fig) adds apps, shortcuts, and autocomplete to your Terminal âœ¨.

***\*Note\****: We currently only work on iTerm2 and the native Terminal on macOS.



**Fig makes developers more productive in the terminal. We're starting with building robust and fast autocomplete.**

New to Fig? Here's an overview of autocomplete and what Fig does: [Getting Started](./Getting Started/getting-started.md).

Want to install Fig? Read through the [Installation Steps](./Getting Started/installation-steps.md).

For troubleshooting and usage information, see the [User Manual](./Support/guide.md).

If you want to contribute and build support for any CLI tool with autocomplete, we recommend you take a look at the [Getting Started with Autocomplete Specs](./Autocomplete/getting-started-with-autocomplete.md).
