### 4. Enable Accessibility Permission

Fig requires Accessibility permissions to insert text on your behalf and read the current keybuffer. 

Make sure the checkbox next to Fig is toggled on. (You might need to click the lock on the bottom left, in order to change the setting.)

**Note**: In some cases, when Fig is updated you may need to reenable this permission.  

If Fig is checked, uncheck it, then check it again.
