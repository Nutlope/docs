## What is Fig?

[Fig](https://withfig.com) adds apps, shortcuts, and autocomplete to your Terminal âœ¨.  Currently, we're focusing on building out fast and robust autocomplete.

## Autocomplete

**Note**: We currently only work on iTerm2 and the native Terminal on macOS.

**What is autocomplete?**

Autocomplete is intellisense for the terminal. We've built our own standard (autocompletion specs) to enable completion for any CLI tool. Users can build their own specs, and we can build our own specs as well.

**Why we're building autocomplete**

Fig wants to make developers more productive in the terminal. Autocomplete was the first product Fig set out to perfect, since having instant, verbose autocompletion could save developers from hours of digging through documentation and coming up with the right options and commands.
