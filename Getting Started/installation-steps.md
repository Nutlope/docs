### 5. Enable Accessibility Permission

Fig uses Accessibility permissions to do its window management. Make sure the checkbox next to Fig is checked. You might have to click the lock in the bottom left.

**Note**: If the Fig sidebar doesn't display on load (e.g. after an update), chances are there is a problem with accessibility permissions.

**Apple Icon (in top left of screen)** → **System Preference → Security & Privacy → Accessibility. -** If Fig is unchecked, check it.

- If Fig is checked, uncheck it, then check it again.
