# Good to go

## Indicator: ðŸŸ¢  Green

Fig should be working normally. It shows your window ID, TTY, current working directory, and input for the terminal.

- If the state is green and the autocomplete window still hasn't appeared make sure the `keybuffer` matches the text you have input in your terminal.
- Go to a new line and try retyping the command.
