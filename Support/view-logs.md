# Viewing Logs

If the fig popup isn’t showing when you think it should, or you're not sure why an autocomplete spec isn't working, you can view the logs to get some more information.

If you can get Fig to show up, right click on the fig popup and click Inspect Element.

Navigate to the console tab. Then go back to your terminal and type the command where you think it should work + a space. e.g. `cd[space] `

The logs have a few error messages that may tell you what is going on (e.g. your cli tool may have an alias… or running a specific command could be failing)… 

If something stands out and you can’t fix it, screenshot the logs and send to the Fig team so we can help! [hello@withfig.com](mailto:hello@withfig.com)
