# CLI tool is not installed

```sql
$ go_fig: command not found: fig
```

If you are using `zsh` and see an error like this in you command prompt, it means that the `fig` CLI has either been uninstalled or deleted from the `PATH`.

To fix this issue, reinstall the Fig CLI tool:

- Fig menu icon > Settings > Developer > Install CLI Tool

To uninstall Fig entirely:

- Fig menu icon > Settings > Uninstall Fig
